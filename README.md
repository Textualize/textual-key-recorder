# Textual Key Recorder

A tool to help record what keys result in what names in a Textual
application.

## Notes to self

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd> is a good example of a key that generates
an escape sequence that isn't known to Textual (in my normal environment,
which is macOS and kitty; use this as a good test of unknown sequence
capture).

The above doesn't work with the keyboard I'm using in the office (the above
is with a Keychron K8) but <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>ยง</kbd> does work.
