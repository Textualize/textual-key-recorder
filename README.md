# Textual Key Recorder

A tool to help record what keys result in what names in a Textual
application.

## Usage

This application **isn't** currently published to PyPi; and it requires
Textual's current `main` (so a Textual **newer** than 0.38.1) to work
correctly.

To use, clone down the repository and then run `make setup`. Once done just
run `make`.
